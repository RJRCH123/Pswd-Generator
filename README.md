# 2. Realization of the Project
## 2.1 Design 📱
### 2.1.1 Low Fidelity Prototyping: 📝

When defining what content would go on the web page, a rough prototype of the distribution was made, with pencil and paper.

### 2.1.2 Wireframe: 🙋🏼
Therefore, in this phase we seek to make a more detailed virtual distribution scheme in Figma.

### 2.1.2 High Fidelity Prototyping: 💁🏼
After having the Wireframe, the web design is made based on styles, color palette, among other resources.
